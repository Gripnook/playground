# Playground

Simple C++ project set up with:
- Conan for package management.
- CMake for building.
- Catch2 for testing.

Includes some basic scripts for getting started on Windows:
- init.cmd - Sets up Conan and CMake. This only needs to run once when initializing the repository.
- build.cmd - Builds the application.
- run.cmd - Runs the application.
